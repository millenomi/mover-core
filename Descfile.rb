# This file describes declaratively which pieces are there to build Mover Core. For now, it's written in a Ruby DSL whose API has not been coded yet, but it will someday.
# A 'part' is what it says â€” it's NOT an entire target, just a piece of a compilation job. A 'cc'-style part is a part that describes how to build something using a C/C++-style compiler such as GCC or Clang.
